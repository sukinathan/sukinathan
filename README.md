currently a security swe working on cryptographic key management infrastructure... using Rust and C++!!

things I've worked on:
- HITL test automation + CI/CD for ventilators
- VPN establishment protocol
- a bunch of firmware to drive FPGAs, facilitate NVRAM storage through SPI, DMA for cross-processor communication in an MPSoC etc...

misc lore:
- I have created many maps (basically game levels, charts, or whatever you wanna call them) for an online rhythm game called [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) and my most iconic one is probably [this](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624#osu/2849253)
- some of my favorite music artists are zutomayo, magdalena bay, and kendrick lamar (probably sounds like a very random mix I know)
- I have ADHD
- I really appreciate lots of workflow tools such as vim, tmux, zsh, i3, fzf, lazygit and so on
- I enjoy bouldering
